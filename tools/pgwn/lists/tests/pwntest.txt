== PostgreSQL Weekly News - August 27 2005 ==

PostgreSQL 8.1 beta1 is out.  Congratulations to all who have
participated in making this happen.
http://www.postgresql.org/developer/beta

Please test the new beta.  Some of the new features are at
http://developer.postgresql.org/docs/postgres/release.html#RELEASE-8-1

Congratulations to Dave Page, the newest addition to Core.  Dave has
headed the pgODBC project for a couple of years, started the pgAdmin
project in 1998, has been our lead webmaster for three years, and is
now sharing responsibility for Win32 packaging with Magnus Hagander.
In these latter two roles, Dave's help is indispensable to the
PostgreSQL release process, so he now gets the title for the work he
is already doing.

Andrew Dunstan and Alvaro Herrera are now committers.  Kudos!
